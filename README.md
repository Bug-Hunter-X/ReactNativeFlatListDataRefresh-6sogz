# React Native FlatList Not Re-rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component fails to re-render after its data source changes.  The issue arises from improper state management or asynchronous data fetching.  The provided solution addresses this problem.

## Bug Description

A React Native application utilizing a FlatList to display data from an external API encounters a rendering issue. Even after successfully fetching and updating the data in the component's state, the FlatList fails to update its display. This results in either a blank screen or inconsistent data presentation.

## Solution

The solution utilizes the `useEffect` hook with a dependency array to ensure that the FlatList re-renders whenever the data state changes.  We also include error handling for robust API calls.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to start the app.
4. Observe that the FlatList initially renders correctly. However, any subsequent data updates will not reflect in the UI. 

## Steps to Solve

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` addresses the issue by including a check on the state data within the useEffect hook.
